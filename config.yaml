    subtitle: "My favorite part of travel is that i get to explore what local people are drinking
    during their everyday lives. And of course when it comes to drinks, who could possibly refuse
    a bottle of chill beer on a hot summer day and a warm mulled wine on a cold winter day? I know I couldn't."
