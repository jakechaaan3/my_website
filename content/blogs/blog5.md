Hi there I'm Jake. Career-wise, I'm aspired to be an equity research analyst and I have worked in boutique real estate private equity as well as financial risk team in department of treasury and finance. Hobby-wise, I like travelling and especially to under-developed country where I could get down to the poor community and find out how people are really getting through everyday life. In addition, I'm into all kinds of drinks, from home-made craft beer to hard liquor. Can't wait to explore bars and pubs here in London.
