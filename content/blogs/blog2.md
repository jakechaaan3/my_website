I finished my undergrad in Melbourne, Australia and have stayed for more than 2 years prior coming to UK.  Melbourne is such a lovely and historical city with so much British memory built-in. My memory of Melbourne stays in those summer days where I had a few drinks with friends alongside Yarra River while watching the sun go down.
